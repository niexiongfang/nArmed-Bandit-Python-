# nArmed-Bandit-Python-
You are faced with n slot machines, each giving a reward per play according to a stationary probability distribution specific to the individual slot machine. Your task is to maximise your payout (cumulative reward) over a given number of plays. This is the n-armed bandit problem.

In the accompanying code a few reinforcement learning methods are implemented.
